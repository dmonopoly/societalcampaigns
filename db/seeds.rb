# # This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with default values.
# # Commands:
# # rake db:reset - drops the db, recreates the db, and loads current schema into db
# # rake db:schema:load - BEWARE: loads current schema into db and consequently destroys all records first!
# # rake db:seed - load seed data; defaults to development
# # rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=test - load seed data for the test db
# # rake db:setup - set up database by running migrations
# # rake db:test:purge - empties the test database.
# # rake db:test:prepare - checks for pending migrations and warns you appropriately (fails when schema DNE)
# # rake db:test:load - recreates the test database from the current db/schema.rb
# # rake test:units, (...) - BEWARE: test db will be erased and re-generated from your development database when you run "rake"
# # ruby -I test test/unit/article_test.rb
# 
# # NOTES:
# # -"create" calls save, whereas "create!" calls "save!"
# #   The difference? "create!" will raise an exception if the record is invalid.
# # -"delete" directly deletes the record, whereas "destroy" triggers callbacks like before_destroy.
# # - Use code like :restaurant=>Restaurant.all[0] for relationships. Apparently, Restaurant.find(1) won't work.
# # - Don't bother with Factory(:user) in seeds.rb because the password is not working. Just do User.create().
# #   (although using it in tests is fine)
# # - For habtm relationship specification, do things like Factory(:meal, :restaurant_ids => [ r.id ]) with
# #   the r.id because specifying restaurant directly for some reason fails to specify the correct id
